# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added
* Branch delay slots: `tools/gen_branch.py` generates `c6000_branch.sinc`,
  and `C6000ParallelSemanticsAnalyzer` lifts a branch together with the
  work in its five delay cycles as SLEIGH delay slots, capturing its
  condition and register target at issue. Calls now see arguments and
  return addresses set in their delay slots, returns see their result and
  restores, and loops see a decrement issued with their branch. The slots
  of unconditional jumps are decoded. Unsupported windows are bookmarked
  (see docs/internals.md). `C6000HazardScan.java` reports branch coverage.
* Packet-accurate p-code: `C6000ParallelSemanticsAnalyzer` and the generated
  `c6000_packet.sinc` wrapper make execute-packet members read pre-packet
  registers and make load, multiply and FP results land after their delay
  slots. It acts only where a hazard exists and bookmarks what it cannot
  model (see docs/internals.md). `C6000HazardScan.java` measures hazards and
  coverage; `tools/test_packet_semantics.sh` runs the emulator test.
* `C6000JumpTableAnalyzer` recovers the TI compiler's switch dispatch
  (guarded `LDW` from an `MVK`/`MVKH` table, then `B`/`BNOP` through the
  entry), which Ghidra's decompiler could not bound. On the CDJ-2000NXS DSP
  all 9 such tables are recovered with their exact case counts; code outside
  any function drops from 16,005 to 10,311 instructions.

### Fixed
* Ghidra marks delay-slot instructions with a leading `_` in the mnemonic;
  the delayed-call analyzer's predicate and packet-header checks and the
  packet-semantics cycle model now ignore it.
* A compact `NOP` displayed its raw N3 field, one less than its cycle count
  (Figure H-9 places N3 where the 32-bit NOP keeps count-1). It now shows
  the count, like the 32-bit form. `C6000LoopBuffer` no longer adds one to a
  `NOP n` count, which also made 32-bit `NOP n` one cycle too long.
* A 32-bit `BNOP` in a header-based (compact) fetch packet scaled its
  displacement by four instead of two, sending its CFG edge into the middle
  of an instruction.
* `B` calls whose delay slots set `B3` are modelled as returning calls: the
  register form (`B reg` after `MVKL`/`MVKH`), the `MVK`/`MVKH` return-address
  form, and unconditional immediate calls, which previously had no
  fall-through and left their delay slots and the code after the return
  point undecoded.
* Predicated `B` calls are recognised in the compiler's if/else call-pair
  form (the other arm in the delay slots, `B3` set before the branch);
  unrecognised predicated immediate calls on the CDJ-2000NXS DSP dropped
  from 30 to 5, all overlapping-branch schedules that are not clear calls.
* In a "call Y if p, else jump to X" pair only the call arm is a call; the
  jump arm (a register arm is always the call; otherwise the nearer target)
  stays a conditional jump, so the local else-block is no longer made a
  function. 26 such arms on the CDJ-2000NXS DSP were wrongly calls.
* Register calls get their `MVK`/`MVKH` target reference in far more cases:
  the look-back now decodes undecoded delay slots and pointer-typed code
  words, follows register moves, skips oppositely predicated writes, and is
  retried when earlier code appears. Register calls without a target on the
  CDJ-2000NXS DSP dropped from 42 to 21; the rest load the target from
  memory or another routine.
* Ghidra's heuristic non-returning-function discovery is disabled for the
  C6000 languages. It marked returning functions no-return because a call's
  delay slots and return point are not decoded until the call is
  recognised, then cleared that code; 203 calls on the CDJ-2000NXS DSP lost
  their fall-through this way.

### Documentation
* The README is now a short overview (install, quick start, features and
  limitations, build, testing). Measured coverage and test fixtures moved to
  `docs/verification.md`, packet, delay-slot, branch and ABI internals to
  `docs/internals.md`, and the detailed limitations (including the
  software-loop model) to `docs/limitations.md`.
* Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` and a "wrong decode or semantics" issue template.
* The ELF loader opinion is documented as matching little-endian files only.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-09-25

First public release.

### Added
* `C6000:LE:32:default` and `C6000:BE:32:default` SLEIGH languages for the
  TMS320C674x DSP and, by subsetting, the C64x, C64x+, C67x and C67x+ parts.
* `C6000:LE:32:analysis` and `C6000:BE:32:analysis` variants with native
  single-precision p-code and an opaque status userop, for reading
  float-heavy code.
* Broad 32-bit instruction decode generated from the SPRUFE8B section 3.12
  opcode tables, with unresolved encodings left undefined for investigation.
* Compact 16-bit instruction decode driven by the fetch-packet header word,
  covering most observed forms in SPRUFE8B appendices C.4, D.4, E.4, F.4,
  G.3 and H.4; unsupported halfwords remain undefined.
* The context fields are declared `noflow`. Without that attribute a compact
  slot reached by fall-through inherits the preceding instruction's decode
  parameters and is decoded as a 32-bit instruction; this was the single
  hardest bug in the port and is recorded here deliberately.
* Modelled p-code semantics for the integer ALU, immediate construction,
  scalar loads and stores, single-precision floating point arithmetic and
  conversions, branches and calls; other decoded instructions lift to an
  explicit userop rather than to silently wrong data flow.
* `C6000PacketAnalyzer` and `C6000PacketContext`, which prime the decode
  context from compact fetch-packet headers before disassembly.
* ELF loader opinion mapping `EM_TI_C6000` (140) to the language.
* C6000 compiler spec implementing the TI C6000 calling convention.
* `C6000CorpusTest.java` corpus/regression script and a GNU-objdump oracle
  harness, plus GitHub Actions CI that builds against Ghidra 12.x and runs the
  tests.
* `tools/gen_fid.py`, which generates Function ID databases from a TI
  run-time library built with the TI C6000 code generation tools.

### Fixed
* `DPINT` and `DPTRUNC` now read a double-precision register pair and perform
  FADCR-aware integer conversion, including ties-to-even and warning bits.
* `SPINT` and `SPTRUNC` now use the `.L1`/`.L2` FADCR rounding mode and update
  conversion warning bits, including exceptional inputs. `SPINT` no longer
  lifts to an unimplemented-operation placeholder.
* `NORM` now distinguishes 32-bit and 40-bit sources, counts the 40-bit sign
  width correctly, and `SUBU` writes its signed 40-bit result to a register
  pair. Both have executable p-code instead of placeholders.
* Compact fetch-packet headers now decode as `CPKT` instead of selecting a
  conflicting 32-bit opcode before predicate validation.
* Signed immediates and `ADDKPC` operands use their documented fields; .L-unit
  five-bit constants use bits 22..18. Both directions of 32-bit `MVC` now move
  between general and named control registers, including the firmware's
  `FADCR` and `FMCR` boot instructions.
* Immediate exports carry a four-byte width, so Ghidra's constant-propagation
  analyzers no longer receive zero-width p-code operands.
* The register forms of `CLR`, `EXT`, `EXTU` and `SET` display their packed
  `src1` operand and lift the manual's bit-field operation; previously they
  showed two immediate fields from the sibling encoding.
* Packet-context priming is safe to repeat on a disassembled image, and the
  headless corpus test reports actual p-code placeholders and unknown slots,
  including Ghidra's one-byte `BAD-Instruction` rows.
* `.D` arithmetic units now use the `s` bit, while short load/store units use
  `y`; long load/store forms execute on `.D2`. Memory offsets are scaled by
  access size, and pre/post addressing modes update the base register after the
  transfer, preserving the old store source when it is also the base register.
* Scalar stores now read their data source from bits 27..23 instead of the
  base-register field at bits 22..18. Doubleword load/store operands display
  register pairs in 32-bit and compact formats; nonaligned doubleword address
  offsets follow their encoded scaled/nonscaled `sc` bit. Odd pair selectors
  in 32-bit aligned doubleword forms remain undefined.
* The TI manual's grouped `LDB(U)` and `LDH(U)` headings now produce separate
  signed and unsigned load encodings. The previous table parse attached their
  layouts to the preceding mnemonics and could display `LDW` words as `INTSPU`.
  Generation now rejects memory diagrams under nonmemory mnemonics and any
  unconstrained opcode-map field.
* CI's synthetic image test scans its actual 48-byte size and checks that all
  12 instructions decode.
* Doubleword loads and stores now lift 64-bit transfers through overlapping
  odd:even register pairs in both endian modes, including compact stack forms.
  The common 16-bit integer multiplies and 16-by-32 `MPYLI` also lift to
  p-code; immediate multiply operands are signed five-bit values.
* `BDEC` and `BPOS` now show their signed fetch-packet-relative target and
  lift conditional branch behavior. Compact register `BNOP` branches through
  its register; compact `MVC` to `ILC` and common `EXT`/`EXTU` forms lift to
  data-flow p-code.
* Selected double-precision conversions, addition, multiplication and
  comparisons now use pair operands and floating-point p-code. `MVD` lifts
  its register copy; pipeline timing and floating-point status side effects
  remain outside the p-code model.
* `SUBC`, `ROTL` and `LMBD` lift their documented integer operations.
  Nonaligned word loads and stores use word-scaled offsets; nonaligned
  doubleword transfers retain doubleword scaling.
* `MPYLHU` and `PACK2` now lift their unsigned halfword multiply and
  halfword packing operations.
* The reverse cross-path forms of `SUBDP` now display the architectural
  source order and lift 64-bit subtraction. `MPY32` and its mixed-sign and
  unsigned pair forms, `MPYHL`/`MPYLH` halfword forms, `MPYI`, and `PACKL4`
  now lift their documented integer operations.

### Notes
* `buildExtension` does not compile SLEIGH. `tools/build.sh` (and CI) run
  `support/sleigh` first and verify that the produced zip contains the `.sla`
  files; without them the zip installs cleanly and then fails at import with
  "Unsupported language".
* Ghidra 12.1.3 has a defect in `GhidraSourceBundle.tryBuild`: a `javac`
  diagnostic with a null source turns the whole script-directory build into a
  `NullPointerException`, which is reported as the misleading
  `Failed to get OSGi bundle containing script`. If every Java script in a
  script directory suddenly stops loading, look for a compile error in a
  sibling `.java` file.
