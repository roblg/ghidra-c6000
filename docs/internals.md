# Internals

How the module models the parts of the C6000 that do not map directly onto
SLEIGH: compact fetch packets, execute packets, delay slots and branch
targets, plus the ABI, the analysis language variants and the source layout.

## Languages

| Language | Use |
|---|---|
| `C6000:LE:32:default` | little-endian C674x / C64x+ / C64x / C67x+ / C67x |
| `C6000:BE:32:default` | big-endian variant (C6000 supports both byte orders) |
| `C6000:LE:32:analysis`, `C6000:BE:32:analysis` | same decode, simplified single-precision p-code for reading float-heavy code (see [below](#floating-point-decompilation)) |

An ELF loader opinion maps `EM_TI_C6000` (e_machine 140) to
`C6000:LE:32:default`, so a little-endian C6000 ELF picks it automatically.
The opinion only matches little-endian files; for a big-endian ELF or a raw
binary, choose the language and (for raw images) the base address yourself.

C674x is the union of the C64x+ and C67x+ instruction sets (SPRUFE8B §1.1), so
one description serves the older parts, which are subsets.

## Compact 16-bit fetch packets

This is the part of C6000 that naive decoders get wrong, so it is worth
describing the model.

A fetch packet is eight 32-bit words (32 bytes). It is a **compact** packet
exactly when bits 31–28 of its eighth word are `1110`; that word is then a
*header* rather than an instruction, its layout field says which of the other
words hold two 16-bit instructions, and its expansion field supplies the
register set (`RS`), LD/ST data size (`DSZ`), saturation (`SAT`) and
branch-mode (`BR`) parameters that a 16-bit opcode cannot express (§3.10.2).

The header sits **after** the instructions it describes. SLEIGH fixes an
instruction's length from the tokens it matches, so a constructor that peeked
at word 7 would have to declare every compact instruction 32 bytes long. The
decode context is therefore primed out of band:

* `c6000.C6000PacketAnalyzer` runs before Ghidra's disassembly pass and writes
  the per-slot context (`c_is16`, `c_isheader`, `c_rs`, `c_dsz`, `c_sat`, `c_br`, `c_prot`, `c_pfollow`)
  for every compact packet.
* `c6000.C6000PacketContext.prime(program, monitor)` is the same logic as a
  static helper, so scripts and headless runs can call it directly; the corpus
  test does exactly that.
* With no context primed, every word decodes as a normal 32-bit instruction — a
  graceful fallback rather than a hard failure.

Only the eighth word of a compact fetch packet decodes as a 4-byte `CPKT`
instruction. The `1110` prefix in bits 31..28 is the reserved predication
encoding `creg=7, z=0` (Table 3-9), so no valid 32-bit instruction matches it.

## Execute packets, delay slots and parallel semantics

* Bit 0 of each 32-bit opcode is its p-bit. A compact 16-bit instruction's
  p-bit comes from bits 13–0 of its fetch-packet header. In either case,
  `p=1` chains the next instruction into the same execute packet, including
  across a fetch-packet boundary.
* Instructions in an execute packet read pre-packet state and commit together,
  and multi-cycle instructions write their destination after their delay
  slots. Ghidra lifts one instruction at a time, so both are handled by the
  packet-accurate p-code described [below](#packet-accurate-p-code).
* Branches (`B`, `BNOP`, `BDEC`, `BPOS`, `CALLP`, ...) take effect after
  five delay cycles and loads land after four. Where a branch's delay cycles
  hold real work, the branch's p-code carries them as SLEIGH delay slots
  (see [below](#branch-delay-slots)); otherwise it jumps at the branch,
  which is exact when the window is only `NOP`s. `CALLP` writes `inst_start
  + 24` to `B3`, matching the five delay slots, which are its own NOPs.
* Branch targets are **PCE1-relative** — relative to the first instruction of
  the containing fetch packet, not to the branch itself. `B`/`CALLP`/`BNOP`/
  `BDEC`/`BPOS`/`ADDKPC` all use `inst_start & 0xFFFFFFE0`, exactly as the
  manual's Execution blocks specify. A 32-bit `BNOP` displacement counts
  words in an ordinary fetch packet but halfwords in a header-based (compact)
  one, so it can reach 16-bit instructions; the `c_hdrpkt` context bit, primed
  with the rest of the packet context, selects the scale. Direct branch and
  call targets export in RAM, so Ghidra's flow references and disassembler
  follow the code address.
  The delayed-call analyzer treats a `B` (immediate or register) as a call
  when its five delay cycles write `B3` with `ADDKPC` or with an `MVK`/`MVKH`
  pair (the `MVK` may precede the branch) to a return address just past the
  delay window. It decodes the delay slots itself when Ghidra has not, gives
  the branch a CALL flow override and a fall-through into its delay slots,
  adds a call reference for a register target loaded by `MVK`/`MVKH` in the
  preceding straight-line code, and recomputes the caller's body. That
  look-back decodes forward from about 40 words earlier, so constants in the
  undecoded delay slots of an earlier jump (or in code words that analysis
  typed as pointers) still count; it follows `MV` and `ADD`/`OR` of zero,
  skips instructions predicated opposite to the branch, and ignores the
  p-code a compact branch borrows from its parallel followers. A register
  call recognised before its constants were decoded is revisited when code
  just before it appears. Predicated
  calls stay conditional; `B B3` stays a return. The TI compiler's if/else
  call pairs are recognised: a branch inside the window is allowed when its
  predicate is the exact opposite of the call's, `B3` may be set before the
  branch, and reaching the return address `B3` already holds ends the window
  (compact packets can skew the cycle count). In such a pair only one arm is
  a call ("call Y if p, else jump to X"): a register arm is the call, and
  between two immediate arms the one with the nearer target (the local
  else-block) stays a conditional jump; arms to the same target both stay
  calls. It also reclaims
  `CALL_RETURN` tail calls that Ghidra guessed before the delay slots were
  understood, but never one whose callee is marked no-return or whose call
  form is terminal, since another analyzer would flip it back and the two
  would loop. The processor spec disables Ghidra's heuristic
  "Non-Returning Functions - Discovered" analyzer (`enableNoReturnAnalysis`):
  it walks the static fall-through after each call, which on C6000 is
  undecoded until the call is recognised, so it marked returning functions
  no-return and then cleared the code that disproved it. The name-based
  "Known" analyzer still runs. A separate
  early analyzer classifies branches through the ABI return register `B3` as
  returns before Ghidra's switch analysis. Unpredicated `B`/`BNOP` register
  branches retain conservative fall-through during code discovery; an analyzer
  redecodes them as terminal branches or returns before Decompiler Switch
  Analysis so the decompiler sees their actual control flow.

* Switch tables. The TI compiler dispatches a switch with a guard
  (`CMPLTU K,idx` or `CMPGTU idx,K`, `K` an immediate or a constant
  register), an `MVK`/`MVKH` table base, the scaled index added in, a
  predicated `LDW` of the entry and `B`/`BNOP` through it, with the
  out-of-range branch in the delay slots. Ghidra's decompiler finds such a
  table but cannot bound it through the predicated delay-slot code ("Too
  many branches"). `C6000JumpTableAnalyzer` recognises the idiom with the
  delayed-call analyzer's look-back, reads the `K+1` entries (stopping early
  at a word that is not an even address in the dispatching block; with no
  guard it recovers nothing), adds them as computed-jump references, decodes
  them and writes a jump-table override so the decompiler emits the
  `switch`. It runs for each new function, so a function a script creates
  later still gets its override, and the late branch pass decodes the cases
  of newly found code. It never rewrites an existing override or refixes an
  unchanged body; doing so retriggered function analysis without end.

The `jump-table.py` fixture and `C6000JumpTableTest.java` check, in both
endian modes, that a guarded three-case dispatch gets exactly its three
targets although a fourth valid code address follows the table, and that the
decompiler emits the `switch`.

The `branch-flow.py` fixture and `C6000FlowTargetTest.java` check eight direct
branch/call forms in both endian modes, including conditional versus
unconditional flow types and a `BNOP` in a header-based packet. The
`delayed-call.py` fixture and `C6000DelayedCallTest.java` check, after
auto-analysis in both endian modes, an `ADDKPC` immediate call and an
`MVK`/`MVKH` register call, an if/else pair of predicated calls with `B3`
set before the first arm, and a call-or-jump pair whose near arm must stay a
jump: all calls fall through into their delay slots, keep
the code after the return point in the caller, and make the callee a
function. Ten stage 2 firmware branch/call sites, including
compact forms, also passed the RAM flow check. On a fresh stage 1 raw import
with entry `0x11801da0`, auto-analysis found functions at `0x11804280`,
`0x118048a0`, and `0x11804360`, with zero `const:` flow-error bookmarks. A raw
binary needs an entry point; `C6000SetEntry.java` supplies it in the GUI and
headless tests. The packet-context analyzer runs before Ghidra's entry-point
disassembler so compact target slots get their width context in time. A fresh
stage 2 import also created a function at the checked `CALLP` target
`0xc0012720`. The return-flow regression checks 480 stage 2 `B3` branches,
including 31 predicated returns that retain their fall-through edge; no
unpredicated return retains a fall-through edge. A late branch analyzer
revisits code discovered during switch analysis; without it, three `BNOP B3`
returns were left as computed jumps.

Ghidra's generic Basic Constant Reference Analyzer can exhaust the heap while
exploring the stage 2 control-flow graph. The C6000-specific analyzer bounds
each propagation walk to 512 bytes, still recovering nearby register-built
targets. A fresh stage 2 raw import with the default analyzers recovered 144
functions with zero `const:` flow-error bookmarks; a 60-second-per-function
audit decompiled all 144. Three remaining Error bookmarks are one branch
into `0xffffffff` fill and two odd-address disassembly attempts, not failures
to decode aligned firmware code. In a separate full-payload sweep followed by
autoanalysis, Decompiler Switch Analysis took about 53 seconds and Stack took
about 4 seconds. The reported `0xc001dd80` merger did not recur.

### Floating-point decompilation

The default `C6000:LE:32:default` and `C6000:BE:32:default` languages retain
the detailed floating-point rounding and status-register model. For reading
float-heavy functions, explicitly select `C6000:LE:32:analysis` or
`C6000:BE:32:analysis` when importing a program. This variant uses native
single-precision p-code for `INTSP`, `INTSPU`, `MPYSP`, `ADDSP`, `SUBSP`, and
the SP comparisons. It represents status-register effects with the opaque
`c6000_fp_status` userop, so its flag values and special rounding cases are
not suitable for emulation. The same stage 2 function at `0xc0008c44`
decompiled to 36 lines with the analysis language versus 219 with the exact
language; the `fVar1 < 1.0` branch was visible in the shorter output.

## Packet-accurate p-code

Compiled C6000 code relies on packet and pipeline timing. In
`SHR B16,31,B5 || MPY B5,B24,B24` the multiply reads the *old* B5, and after
`LDW *A3,A3` the next four cycles still see the old A3. Lifting instructions
one at a time in address order gets both wrong. On a C674x audio DSP image,
`C6000HazardScan.java` found 962 same-packet read-after-write conflicts and
several thousand delay-slot reads in 12,085 execute packets.

The model follows the approach of Ghidra's Hexagon module (shadow
registers committed at the end of a packet), adapted to C6000's
variable-length packets and delay slots:

* `tools/gen_packet.py` generates `c6000_packet.sinc`. Every root
  constructor now requires `ep_phase=1`. A wrapper at `ep_phase=0` builds
  the instruction between `EpSv` (`R_sv = R`), `EpPo` and `EpCo`
  subtables, each switched per register by a noflow context bit:
  * `eps<R>`: park this member's write in `R_pk` and restore R, because a
    later member of the same packet reads R;
  * `epd<R>`: park this multi-cycle result in `R_dl` and restore R, because
    something reads or writes R before the result lands;
  * `epc<R>` / `epe<R>`: on the last member of the packet (for `epe`, the
    packet in which the result lands) commit `R = R_pk` / `R = R_dl`;
  * `ep_cpre`: commit *before* the last member when it is a branch, so the
    template has no p-code after the branch.
  * `ep_any` selects the plain wrapper, `{ build instruction; }`, for every
    slot without hazard bits. Ghidra derives flow types from the constructor
    templates, so any `build` after a branch would make every branch
    conditional.
* `C6000ParallelSemanticsAnalyzer` (after the late branch pass) groups each
  function's instructions into execute packets by p-bit, assigns cycles, and
  sets the bits only where a hazard exists. A `NOP n` packet takes n cycles.
  `BNOP n` and `ADDKPC` take n after their own cycle (`B; NOP N` equals
  `BNOP N`). `CALLP` adds five cycles, and a load in a PROT=1 compact fetch
  packet adds four (SPRUFE8B 3.10.2). Delay slots come from
  `C6000ParallelSemantics.delaySlots`: loads 4, 16-bit multiplies 1, 32-bit
  and single-precision FP operations 3, and double-precision operations up
  to 9.
* The analyzer only acts where the whole delay window is straight-line code
  in one function body. It bookmarks, and leaves sequential, any case with a
  branch or an entry point inside the window, two in-flight delayed writes of
  one register, a register written by two members of one packet, a packet
  hazard next to a branch that is not the packet's last member, or an
  `SPLOOP` body. A branch whose delay slots are inlined (below) is no
  obstacle: its window is straight-line code inside its own p-code. On the
  C674x image this covers 80% of packet hazards. Most of the remainder are
  software-pipelined loops whose loads land in the next iteration, across
  the loop's branch.

Ghidra's p-code emulator flows its own decode context and does not read
per-address noflow values. An emulator user must load the program context
before each step, as `C6000PacketSemanticsTest.java` does. The decompiler
uses the listing's instructions and needs nothing extra.

### Branch delay slots

A C6000 branch takes effect after five delay cycles, and the execute packets
issued in those cycles run on the taken and the fall-through path alike. The
TI compiler fills them: argument set-up and the return address for a call,
the epilogue's register restores for a return, a loop's counter decrement. A
branch lifted as an immediate jump hides all of that on the taken path, so
`return;` appears where the function returned a value computed in its
return's delay slots, and a call's arguments appear to be set after it.

* `tools/gen_branch.py` generates `c6000_branch.sinc`: for every branching
  root constructor (`B`, `BNOP`, `BDEC`, `BPOS`, `B IRP`/`NRP` and the
  compact forms) a variant selected by the noflow context bit `ep_br`. It
  captures the condition (`BR_c`) and a register target (`BR_t`) at issue,
  as the hardware does, then inlines the window with SLEIGH's `delayslot`
  directive (subtable `BrDs`, window length in `ep_ds` halfwords), then
  branches on the captured values. `CALLP` is not varied: its delay cycles
  are its own NOPs. An unpredicated register branch not yet classified
  (`c_branch_terminal=0`) becomes `call [BR_t]`, which keeps its
  fall-through and takes the delayed-call or return analyzer's flow
  override. SLEIGH warns once per `BrDs` constructor that a delay slot is
  used in a subtable; Ghidra's prototype walk handles it.
* Ghidra then treats the window as delay slots: the branch's fall-through
  is the first address after the window (for a call, the return address),
  the listing marks slot instructions with `_`, and the decompiler sees the
  window's p-code, packet and pipeline semantics included, on both paths.
* `C6000ParallelSemanticsAnalyzer` picks the window: the rest of the
  branch's packet and the packets up to five cycles after it. It sets
  `ep_br` only when the window holds something other than `NOP`, or a
  multi-cycle result is in flight, and decodes the slots of unconditional
  jumps, which Ghidra never follows, first. It rebuilds the branch and its
  window together from the stored context, because Ghidra's flow
  disassembler does not carry every per-address noflow bit into delay
  slots, and adds the slots to the function body.
* It bookmarks and leaves immediate: a branch or call inside the window
  (the TI if/else and call-or-jump pairs), a jump into the window, a
  window mixing 16- and 32-bit instructions (Ghidra re-parses delay slots
  with the branch's context, so their widths must agree under it), a
  `BDEC` whose counter another member of its packet uses, a delayed write
  issued in the window that lands after the branch, and `SPLOOP` bodies.

On the C674x image, 430 of the 919 branches whose delay cycles hold work
are inlined, and packet- and delay-hazard coverage rises slightly because a
branch in a delay window is no longer always an obstacle. The largest
remaining groups are branches in each other's windows (275), delayed writes
landing after their branch (198) and mixed-width compact windows (133).

## Calling convention

`data/languages/c6000.cspec` implements the C6000 C ABI:

| | |
|---|---|
| arguments | A4, B4, A6, B6, A8, B8, A10, B10, A12, B12, then the stack |
| 32-bit return | A4 |
| return address | B3 |
| stack pointer | B15 |
| frame pointer | A15 |
| data pointer | B14 |
| callee-saved | A10–A15, B10–B15 |

## Function ID

`tools/gen_fid.py` builds a Function ID database from a TI run-time library.
The **`.fidbf` is deliberately not shipped**: the TI code generation tools'
licence does not clearly permit redistributing a database derived from TI's RTS,
and the safe default is to ship the generator and let each user build it from
their own CGT install. Read the script's header before redistributing anything
it produces.
